## About
This repo contains the source code for the following set of articles:  (parts2 and 3)

[Part 1](https://davemateer.com/2019/01/11/Learning-Functional-Programming-in-C-Sharp) summarised how I started in FP in C# by learning LINQ and trying Project Euler puzzles.  

[Part 2](https://davemateer.com/2018/09/20/Improve-Programming-using-Project-Euler) is a detailed look at the first Euler puzzle with [source for the first puzzle](https://github.com/djhmateer/FPInCSharpDemos) and [source code for the next 17 puzzles using Imperative and LINQ](https://davemateer.visualstudio.com/_git/Euler1)  

[Part 3](https://davemateer.com/2019/03/12/Functional-Programming-in-C-Sharp-Expressions-Options-Either) is this article on making C# code more functional by using abstractions from the [excellent functional c# library](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext):
